TL;DR: We investigate hyperparameters in RL by building landscapes of algorithm performance for different hyperparameter values at different stages of training. Using these landscapes we empirically demonstrate that adjusting hyperparameters during training can improve performance, which opens up new avenues to build better dynamic optimizers for RL.
