# Announcing the AutoRL workshop at ICML 2024, Vienna

We are excited to announce that the first AutoRL workshop was accepted at ICML to be held in Vienna this year. The [workshop website](https://autorlworkshop.github.io/) contains more details. 
The workshops page for ICML is [here](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/events/workshop) and the AutoRL workshop page on the ICML website can be found [here](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/workshop/29960)

Our goal is to bring together people working in different corners of this problem to share their expertise, methods and ideas. We are looking forward to cutting-edge and state-of-the-art submissions from the community. 

We also have cool speakers and some discussions planned, so mark your calendars (26 or 27 July) and stay tuned!

Come discuss with us how to make RL work out of the box, be it via meta-learning, AutoML, LLMs or whatever else you can think of! ðŸš€ See you in Vienna!
