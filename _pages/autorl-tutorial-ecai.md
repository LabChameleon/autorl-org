# Beyond Trial & Error: A Tutorial on Automated Reinforcement Learning

This page serves as an overview of André Biedenkapp and Theresa Eimer's tutorial on AutoRL at ECAI 2024. We will add slides and code examples at a later point.

### Outline
Introduction and algorithmic part on AutoRL (60min):
1. Motivation: Why does AutoRL matter?
2. Formal definition of AutoRL
3. Categories of AutoRL approaches (i.e. giving an overview of
what AutoRL encompasses)
4. Properties of AutoRL landscapes
5. What are AutoRL-specific challenges compared to AutoML for
supervised learning?
6. Why are dynamic configuration approaches important for RL,
and how do we learn them?

15min break

Practical Session I: Working with design decisions (45min):
1. Examples of adapting different design decisions (e.g. hyperpa-
rameters and environments)
2. Defining AutoRL search spaces
3. Measuring AutoRL performance

Practical guidelines and case study of hyperparameters (45min):
1. Examples of successful AutoRL DAC and online approaches
2. Evaluation and Generalization of AutoRL
3. Options for HPO with pros and cons (AC methods, PBT, heuris-
tics, meta-gradients, etc.)
4. Hyperparameters and experimental design
5. Combining HPO with other AutoRL domains and why this is
important for RL generally

15min break

Practical Session II: Tools for HPO in RL (45min):
1. Applying standard AutoML tools in RL
2. Considerations for dynamic HPO
3. RL-specific HPO tools


### Speakers
**Theresa Eimer** is a Ph.D. student at the Leibniz University of Hannover focusing on the intersection of AutoML and Reinforcement Learning. Her goal is to make Reinforcement Learning work out of the box through better generalization and automatic configuration.

**André Biedenkapp** is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Freiburg focusing on dynamic configuration with and for deep reinforcement learning.
With his work, he aims to democratize deep reinforcement learning.
