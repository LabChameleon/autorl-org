# Tutorial on AutoRL 2024

This page serves as an overview of Andr√© Biedenkapp and Theresa Eimer's tutorial on AutoRL at ECAI 2024. We will add slides and code examples at a later point.

The tutorial outline is:
1. Introduction and algorithmic part on AutoRL
- Motivation: Why does AutoRL matter?
- Formal definition of AutoRL
- Categories of AutoRL approaches (e.g. learning to learn, environment design, etc.)
- Properties of AutoRL landscapes
- What are AutoRL-specific challenges compared to AutoML for supervised learning? 
- Why are dynamic configuration approaches important for RL, and how do we learn them? 

2. Practical guidelines and case study of hyperparameters:
- Examples of successful AutoRL, DAC and online approaches
- Evaluation and Generalization of AutoRL
- HPO for RL
- Hyperparameters and experimental design
- Forms of optimization with pros and cons (AC methods, PBT, heuristics, meta-gradients, etc.)
- Combining HPO with other AutoRL domains and why this is important for RL generally
